BubbleIcons is a lightweight addon for WoW 3.3.5 that displays raid target icons in chat bubbles. On Thaddius, DBM shows raid markers in bubbles (blue square for positive, red cross for negative), but the 3.3.5 client can't display these by default. While addons like ElvUI or Prat can do this, I wanted something lightweight that only does this one thing. The addon automatically converts typed markers like {skull} or {cross} into actual icon textures, supports all localizations, and requires no configuration.
